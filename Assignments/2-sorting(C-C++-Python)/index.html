<h1>Assignment 2</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> The purpose of this assignment is for students to become familiar with
compiling, running, and testing programs in the Unix environment, using
library routines, and the concept of generic programming. &nbsp;Students
will be introduced to a few of the languages of the course, C, C++, and
Python, and will have a chance to review a fundamental algorithm, namely
quicksort.  &nbsp;Most of the coding for the assignment will simply involve
writing main programs and either using library routines or code from class.
See <a href="../Lectures/4.html">Lecture 4</a> for relevent material and
code. </p>

<p> The assignment involves sorting strings. &nbsp;A main program will be
written that reads strings, one per line, from standard input, and writes
the same strings, in sorted order, to standard output. &nbsp;This interface
is the same as the Unix <tt><b>sort</b></tt> filter, except that only one
string per line is allowed and the options that <tt><b>sort</b></tt>
supports are not included. </p>

<p> Sorting is a very common operation and is widely supported through
standard library routines for different languages. &nbsp;Rather than
reinventing the wheel, when sorting is required it is a good idea to use a
library routine.  &nbsp;A good library routine must provide a good interface
(see chapter 4 of the text) and should support many different situations
(i.e. different types of elements that are to be sorted). &nbsp;Algorithms
that support different data types are called generic and programming to
support generic algorithms is called generic programming. &nbsp;Different
languages have different types of support for generic programming (e.g.
<nobr><tt>void*</tt></nobr> and function pointers in C, templates and
virtual methods in C++, interfaces and the Object class in Java). &nbsp;As
part of this assignment you will investigate support for generic programming
in different languages. &nbsp;While it is generally not a good idea to
implement your own sorting routine, it is good to be aware of the algorithms
that are available, be able to read code implementing the algorithm, and to
be aware of the behavior and runtime of important algorithms (this will be
pursued later in the assignment on performance). </p>

<h2> Problems </h2>

<p> For each problem, you are to write a separate main program. &nbsp;All
main programs should follow the same interface as indicated in the
introduction. </p>


<ol>
	<li>Write and test a main program in C, that reads strings (one per line)
		from standard input and writes the same strings in sorted order to
		standard out, one string per line. &nbsp;Use an array of pointers to
		character arrays to store the strings.  I.e., you have a
		statically-allocated array of pointers, <tt><nobr>char *[LINE_CAP] =
			0;</nobr></tt> (you may assume you won't have more than 100,000
		lines to parse, see below).  You will then use <tt>malloc</tt> or
		<tt>strdup</tt> to get memory for each line, as needed.  There are
		examples in your book.  <strong>Don't forget to give the memory back,
		using <tt>free</tt> (not <tt>delete</tt>).</strong> </p>

		<p> You should use the quicksort code from class to sort the strings.
		&nbsp;This code was modified to sort an array of character arrays (see
		<a target='_blank'
			href='../Programs/C/qsort_string.c'><tt>qsort_string.c</tt></a>).
		&nbsp;See the lecture notes on C for how to read/write strings. </p>
	</li>

	<li>Redo question 1 using the C library routine <tt>qsort</tt> (you will
	need to supply a <tt>compare()</tt> function).</li>

	<li>Redo question 1 in C++, modifying the provided quicksort code, to use
		a template.  Use a <tt>vector</tt> of <tt>string</tt>s to store the
		strings:

		<blockquote><tt>template &lt;class S&gt;<br />
			void myQSort( vector&lt;S&gt; &amp;v );</tt></blockquote>
	
		<p> You may assume (require that) the <tt><b>&lt;</b></tt> operator
		is defined for type <tt>S</tt>. </p></li>

	<li>Redo question 3 using the C++ <tt>sort</tt> routine, found in the
	<tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> header file.</li>

	<li>Write and test a program in Python that reads strings (one per
	line) from standard input and writes the same strings in sorted order to
	standard output.<br>
	See the lecture notes on Python for how to read/write strings.</li>

</ol>

<hr>
<h2> Description of input </h2>

<p> You may expect no more than 1,000,000 lines of input.  You may further
assume that each line has no more than 80 characters (careful here).
Finally, strings (lines) will have no whitespace. </p>

<p> This is like certain examples we've seen already.  Treat <tt>stdin</tt>
as a file, read until EOF, don't prompt, etc.  (If you want to get fancy,
test for a TTY, that's on you.) </p>

<hr>
<h2> Description of output </h2>

<p> You will output the sorted list of strings, one per line, to stdout. </p>

<h2> What to hand in </h2>



<!--
<p> Create some appropriate directory for this assignment.  It will contain a
file called <tt>README</tt> that describes all of the files, and summarizes
what you did. Make sure to indicate if any of the problems were not done or
are not working. </p>

<p> For each problem, create a subdirectory called <tt>prob<i>i</i></tt>,
where <tt><i>i</i></tt> is the problem number. &nbsp;In each directory
create a file called <tt>main.<i>ext</i></tt>, where <tt><i>ext</i></tt> is
the appropriate extension for the language being used (<tt>c</tt>,
<tt>cc</tt>, <tt>py</tt>), with your main program.  You may use more than 1
file for each program, as you see fit.  Put a brief comment in each main
program file indicating the author, what the program does, the date and
platform info, and how to use the program.  &nbsp;In each directory also
create a makefile that builds the executable and runs it (this is trivial
for the Python program). </p>

<p> Each makefile will have a <tt>run</tt> target.  I will supply my own
input, so, don't do this in the makefile.  <a target='265sample'
	href='makefile'>Here is a sample for problem 1</a>.  <b>Note</b>: please
do not copy and paste this file; rather, download it using your browser, or
copy it from my directory.  The command line that follows each target must
start with a tab character (at least, it did back in the day). </p>

<p> Please also supply a <tt>clean</tt> target that removes object files and
executable binaries (for the compiled languages). </p>

<p> Optionally, for your own benefit, you might consider a <tt>test</tt>
target.  <a target='CS265'
	href='http://www.cs.drexel.edu/~kschmidt/Ref/make.html'>See here</a> for
more information on makefiles. </p>
-->

<p> Make sure you test each program. &nbsp;Include the file containing sample
strings that you used to test your program.  It will be in the parent
directory, and called <tt>testInput</tt> . </p>

<!--
<p> From within your assignment directory, the parent of the
<tt>prob<i>i</i></tt> directories, tar/gzip the contents to a file called
		<tt><b>a2.tgz</b></tt>: </p>

<blockquote><tt>
 $ tar -zcvf a2.tgz *
</tt></blockquote>

<p> to create the desired gzipped tar file. &nbsp;See 
<tt>man tar</tt> or <tt>info tar</tt> for more information about tar. </p>

<p> Submit your tarfile to WebCT. </p>
