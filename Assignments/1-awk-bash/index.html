<h1>Assignment -- Awk, Bash</h1>

<p>Note this assignment has 2 parts, 2 different tasks for you.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Finding Anagrams</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to get some experience using AWK, and
explore the UNIX philosophy of combining simple programs using pipes can
solve an interesting problem.  The problem is to find all anagrams in a file
containing words.  The UNIX tools that will be used are:  (1) a small C
program that uses system calls to do string operations and sorting, (2) the
UNIX sort command, (3) a small AWK program, and finally the UNIX tail
command.</p>

<h3>Problem Statement and Solution</h3>

<p>Two words are anagrams if one can be obtained from the other by permuting
the letters.  For example, the words stop and pots are anagrams since the
letters "s", "t", "o", and "p" in stop can be rearranged to obtain the word
pots.</p>

<p>A naive way to test if two words are anagrams is to produce all permutations
of the letters of one of the words and compare each possible permuted
sequence of letters to the other word.  If any sequence is equal to the other
word then they are anagrams.  For example, to determine if "ant" and "tan"
are anagrams, we first generate the six possible permutations of the letters
in ant:</p>

<blockquote><pre>ant
atn
nat
nta
tan
tna</pre></blockquote>

<p>and compare each to tan.  Since the 5th permuted sequence is equal to tan,
ant and tan are anagrams.</p>

<p>The problem with this approach is that as the number of letters increases,
the number of permuted sequences gets very big.  For example, there are
3,628,800 permutations of a 10 letter word.</p>

<p>A better approach to test if two words are anagrams is to sort the letters
in each word and then compare the sorted words.  If the words are anagrams
then they must have the same letters and if they have the same letters
then they are anagrams.  Therefore this test determines if two words are
anagrams with one comparison.  For example, if we sort the letters in 
stop and pots, we obtain the letter sequence opts for both words, which shows
that they are anagrams.</p>

<p>Given a file containing a list words we want to find all of the anagrams.
We will do this by dividing the words into anagram classes.  An anagram
class containing a particular word is the collection of words in the
input list that are anagrams of the given word.  Note that if two words
are anagrams to a given word then they are anagrams to each other.  Thus
any two words in an anagram class are anagrams.  Moreover, all of the
words in the input file that are anagrams to any of the words in the anagram
class are contained in the anagram class.</p>

<p>A naive way to find all of the anagram classes is for each word to
search through all of the other words and check each to see if it
is an anagram.  This approach is very time consuming.  A better approach
would be to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>For each word in the file sort the letters to produce a key, a
		<i>cardinal representation</i> of that word.  Produce a one-line entry
		like this:
			<blockquote><tt>opts stop</tt></blockquote>
	</li>
	<li>Sort all of the lines in the input file by their key, that first
		column.</li>
	<li>In the sorted list find all adjacent words with the same key (these
		are the anagram classes).</li>
</ol>

<p>This will be implemented in UNIX in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use a C program called <tt>sign</tt> (look at <a target='265file'
		href='sign.c'>sign.c</a>) to read the <tt>stdin</tt> (the dictionary on
	our machines, <tt>/usr/share/dict/words</tt>) and to produce an output
	file where each line contains the key (the letters of the word sorted)
	followed by the word.  This program will read from standard input and
	write to standard output so that we do not have to specify the input file
	in the program and we can use the output in a pipe.  The name of the the
	executable program will be called <tt>sign</tt>.

	<blockquote><tt>gcc -osign sign.c</tt></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>The temporary file containing words and keys produced in (1) will be
sorted using the UNIX sort command.</p></li>

<li><p>Use an AWK program to collect all adjacent words with the same key.
The result will be a file containing an anagram class per line.  The
file containing the awk program is <a target='265file' href='squash.awk'>
squash.awk</a> .</p>

<p>Here is the UNIX command to do this.  The file
<tt>/usr/share/dict/words</tt> contains a list of words (almost 235,000,
currently).  To verify this use the command <tt>wc</tt>.</p>

	<blockquote><tt>
	<nobr>% sign &lt; /usr/share/dict/words | sort | awk -f squash.awk &gt;
	out</nobr>
	</tt></blockquote>

<p>The output will be in the file <tt>out</tt>.  The awk command can be put
into a file called bash script called <tt>squash</tt> .  Such a file
containing UNIX commands is called a shell script and is itself interpred as
a command as soon as the execute permission has been set.  The resulting
UNIX pipe, which uses the shell script squash instead of the call to awk,
becomes:</p>

	<blockquote><tt>
		<nobr>% sign &lt; /usr/share/dict/words | sort | squash &gt; out</nobr>
	</tt></blockquote>

<p>You could, alternatively, make the awk script executable (there are
examples in the lab directory).</p>

<p>To find the largest anagram classes, we can use awk to first count the
number of words in each class, output another file, where a line is preceded
by the count, and the cardinal representation (the old key) is removed:</p>

	<blockquote><tt><pre> 7 opts pots stop ...</pre></tt></blockquote>

<p>, and then sort the file by these counts.  Here is a UNIX command to do
this:</p>

	<blockquote><tt>
		<nobr>% awk '{ print NF " " $0}' &lt; out | sort -n | tail</nobr>
	</tt></blockquote>

<p>In this command the AWK program is given between the single quotes (in
this case we don't want the shell interpreting any of the special characters
in there).  The UNIX command prints the last 10 lines of a file.  Here is
some sample output:</p>

<blockquote><tt>
<pre>4 glare lager large regal
4 lament mantel mantle mental
4 lascar rascal sacral scalar
4 leap pale peal plea
4 leapt petal plate pleat
4 least slate stale steal
4 mate meat tame team
4 pare pear rape reap
4 resin rinse risen siren
5 caret carte cater crate trace</pre>
</tt></blockquote>

<p>Students should try these commands to see if they can produce similar
output.  Note that you can view the output of any intermediate stage
by piping the results through more.  For example:</p>

	<blockquote><tt>
		<nobr>%  sign &lt; /usr/share/dict/words | more</nobr>
	</tt></blockquote>

<p>You can quit more by typing "q" ("man more" for more info on more).</p>

<p>You can submit as many source files as you like.  There needs to be a
top-level script called <tt><b>anagram</b></tt> that puts it all
together.  This will be called to do the work.  See the <a target='265file'
	href='Makefile'>Makefile</a> .</p>

</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3>A "safe" delete</h3>

<p>Write, as a script, a "safe" delete command. Filenames passed as
command-line arguments to this script are not deleted, but instead
gzipped (with compression), then moved to the trash directory, specified in
<tt>$TRASH</tt> (use <tt>$HOME/.trash/</tt> if this variable is not set).
At invocation, the script checks the "trash" directory for files older than
48 hours and deletes them.</p>

<p>Each delete will create a tarball named
<blockquote><nobr><tt><i>yy</i>-<i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i>
<i>HH</i>.<i>MM</i>.<i>SS</i>.tgz</tt></nobr></blockquote>

<p>, where</p>

<table>
  <tr><td><i>yy</i></td>
    <td>last 2 digits of year</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i>mm</i></td>
    <td>month, 01..12</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i>dd</i></td>
    <td>day, 01..31</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i>HH</i></td>
    <td>hour, 01..24</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i>MM</i></td>
    <td>minute, 01..59</td></tr>
  <tr><td><i>SS</i></td>
    <td>second, 01..59</td></tr>
</table>

<p>, and placed in a directory as specified in the $TRASH variable (if it is
not set, you are to use <tt>$HOME/.trash/</tt>).  You'll need to create this
directory if it doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Read on the <tt>date</tt> command; you can specify a format for
output.</p>

<p>Also, read on the <tt>tar</tt> command; by default, relative path
information is stored.  But, for this task, you'd want to store the full
path, so deleted entries can be restored, regardless of the current
directory.</p>

<p>For purging the trash directory you can parse the filenames, or, take a
closer look at the <tt>-mtime</tt> test in the <tt>find</tt> utility.</p>

<p>This file will be called <tt><b>myRm</b></tt>

<p>I'll probably add details, answer questions.  In the meantime, make
<u>good</u> use of the discussion board.</p>
