<h1> Simulate the Knight's</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>This assignment will give you practice with Java (ant, jar).

<p> You will simulate
postfix, and then evaluates it.</p>

<p> You will use <tt>ant</tt> to build  your program </p>

<hr>
<h2> The Assignment </h2>

<p> You will write a Java program that attempts to solve the Knight's Tour
for a given board by brute-force methods.  The Knight's Tour is an attempt
to move the knight on a board, such that each space is visited exactly once.
See the Web for more information. </p>

<p> Your program will read 3 arguments: rows, columns, attempts .  The first
2 arguments are the size of the board, rows x columns.  The last argument is
the number of attempts to make. </p>

<p> The knight will start at (1, 1).  Look around, see what moves are
availabe, and randomly choose one (note, that is <strong>not</strong> the
same as randomly choosing a move, and then seeing if it's legal).  If you
have no more moves (and you haven't covered the board), then the knight
didn't make it. </p>

<p> You then make another attempt, starting at (1, 1), until the knight
succeeds, or you've used up the number of attempts.  At the end, whichever
the outcome, you will print a history of the knight's last attempt.  E.g.,
given a 3x3 board, output:</p>

<pre> 1  6  3 
 4  x  8 
 7  2  5</pre>

<p> Your code will be documented properly, using Javadoc-style comments, for
each class, and each method. </p>


<p> All will be done through an <tt>ant</tt> file.  Set up arguments for
running the program.  4x4 board, 50 attempts. </p>


<p>I will also run Javadoc; I expect to get something useful out.</p>


<hr>
<h3>Your code</h3>

<p> You'll need some smart way to store the moves you made on the board.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p> The history of the last attempt, as described above. </p>

<hr>
<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>I am NOT looking for a lot of comments here.  Remember, your code should
read like a book.  But, each class should have a description, and each
method should have a description and a discussion of inputs, side-effects,
etc.</p>

<p>You will use Javadoc-style comments.  HTML documentation will be created
from your code, using <tt>ant</tt> (and <tt>javadoc</tt>, of course).</p>

<p>The HTML files will end up in a subdirectory of your source dir (which is
also the CWD) called <tt><b>docs/</b></tt>.</p>

<p>See <tt>CS265/Labs/Java/Javadoc/</tt> for an example.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Ant</h3>

<p>You will include a <tt>build.xml</tt> that has, at a minimum, the
following targets:</p>

<ul>
	<li><tt><b>compile</b></tt> - compiles all of your <tt>.java</tt>
		files.</li>
	<li><tt><b>run</b></tt> - runs your program, with the arguments described
		above.  Depends on the <tt>compile</tt>
		<br> <b>Note</b>, the code will need to be compiled from your
		source.  I will delete all <tt>class</tt> files before we start, so...
		The <tt>run</tt> target will make sure all of your source files are run
		through <tt>javac</tt>.</li>
	<li><tt><b>doc</b></tt> - runs <tt>javadoc</tt> on all of your source
		files, creating files in <tt>./docs</tt></li>
</ul>

<p> Note, since you're supplying <tt>build.xml</tt>, the names for the rest
of the code don't matter.  You can have 1 class, or 18 (though, that is
probably overkill).  The filenames don't matter to me (that is, they should
be good names, but I don't need to know them ahead of time). </p>


<hr>
<h2>Submission</h2>

<ul>
	<li><tt><b>build.xml</b></tt> - your ant configuration file</li>
	<li><u>all</u> of your <strong>source</strong> files.  <tt>.class</tt>
		files will be deleted before I start, so, must be built from
		source.</li>
	<li><tt><b>README</b></tt> <i>optional</i> - anything you want to say to
		me before I grade.</li>
</ul>

<b>Please note</b>  You will use the filenames as listed here, and submit
them all to the proper assignment.  If this is <b>not</b> clear, then see me
in class.  If I get programs submitted to the wrong directories, I will be
irate, which may, in some subconscious way, affect your grades.
