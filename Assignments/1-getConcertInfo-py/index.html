<h1>Assignment - get Philly concert info</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is for students to become familiar with
writing simple Python scripts, to use built-in containers (data structures),
and to see how modules can make some daunting tasks fairly simple.</p>

<!--
<p>You will write a Python program that will look at WXPN's site, <a
	target='265sample'
	href='http://www.xpn.org/concerts.php'>http://www.xpn.org/concerts.php</a>,
and display concert information.</p>
-->
<p>You will write a Python program that will look at Camden County Parks's
site, <a target='sample'
	href='http://www.ccparks.com/events/eventsall.php'>
		http://www.ccparks.com/events/eventsall.php</a>,
and display concert information.</p>

<p>The user interface will have 2 stages:</p>
<ol>
	<li>List, in alphabeticl order, all the artists that are in town.</li>
	<li>Allow the user to choose (menu-style); then display the date(s) and
		the venue(s) (along w/the artist).</li>
</ol>

<p>You will, after some input (you decide), bring the user back to the menu,
which will also have a "quit" option.</p>

<p>Note, an artist may have more than one gig in the area; <i>all</i> of the
relevant information must be stored.</p>

<p>What I'm thinking (for retrieval purposes) is a dictionary of lists, very
much as was done in the <a target='sample'
	href='../Programs/Python/markov.py'>markov.py</a> program.</p>

<p>You might need to use something else to store information for the menu
you present to the user.</p>

<p>Don't go too nuts w/the parsing.  For this assignment, <b>Chi-lites</b>
and <b>Chilites</b>, e.g., can be considered as 2 distinct artists.</p>

<h3><tt><b>urllib</b></tt> module - making an HTTP request</h3>

<p>The <tt>urllib</tt> module lets you request a webpage and capture the
page that is returned.  We're going very simply here; We won't fill in agent
info, check for an updated page, etc.  Just open a connection, get the file
down, and parse it.</p>

<p>I have provided an example of this in <a target='sample' href=
	'../../Programs/Python/getConcertInfo.py'>getConcertInfo.py</a>.  You can
slurp the entire file down into a single string, or each line as an element
in a list.  Whichever you prefer for parsing (note: you'll want to look a
bit more closely at regexps; as presented in earlier examples using
<tt>awk</tt> or <tt>sed</tt>, a regexp didn't cross a newline.  But they
can, depending on what you want).</p>

<h2>Some other notes</h2>

<p>While you're working on the parsing bit I would simply pull down the
page to local disk, and open it from there, to avoid maybe annoying the XPN
webmasters.  It's only polite, especially since you're not identifying
yourself.</p>

<p>So, you can open it from Python as you would any other file.  When you're
ready, just change the <tt>open</tt> to go get the actual file from the Web
(this returns a file-like object, has the same read methods, etc.)</p>

<hr>
<h2>What to hand in</h2>

<ul>
	<li><tt><b>getConcertInfo.py</b></tt> - Your complete Python program</li>
	<li><tt><b>README</b></tt> <i>(optional)</i> - anything you want/need to
	tell us</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, use the filenames <b>as shown here</b>.  I.e.,
<tt>README.txt</tt> will <i>not</i> be read before grading.</p>
