<h1>Assignment - Reporting Baseball Player Statistics</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> Perhaps in no other sport does statistics play as major a role as in the
game of Baseball. In fact, certain numbers, such as 56 (length of Joe
DiMaggio's hitting streak), 73 (Barry Bonds' single season home run record)
and 755 (Hank Aaron's career home run record) are part of American sports
culture. </p>

<p> The purpose of this assignment is for students to become familiar with
writing simple Python scripts, to use built-in containers (data
structures), and to develop a "user friendly" interface utilizing Python's
input / output capabilities. </p>

<p> You will write a Python program that reads in Baseball statistics for
players on various teams from a CSV (comma separated value) file and display
statistical information for a specified player.  You will allow the user to
find a player and display his statistics. </p>


<h2>The interface</h2>

<p>The interface will be via the terminal (stdin, stdout).  The user
interface will have 3 stages:</p>

<ol>
	<li> List, in alphabetical order, all teams represented within the file.
	</li>
	<li> Allow the user to choose (menu style) a team, and then display all
	players for that team </li>
	<li> Allow the user to choose (menu style) a player and then display the
	full set of statistics for that player </li>
</ol>

<p> You will, after some input (you decide), bring the user back to the main
(team list) menu, which will also have a "quit" option. </p>

<p> When you list out the teams or players, enumerate them, so that the user
can choose by entering a number; don't make the user type out text (team or
player names), etc. </p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p> Player statistics input are provided in <a target='_blank'
	href='sample.in'>sample.in</a> </p>

<p> The following fields are included for each record, as follows: </p>

<ol>
	<li> player's last name </li>
	<li> player's first name </li>
	<li> player's team </li>
	<li> player's position </li>
	<li> number of at bats </li>
	<li> number of base hits </li>
	<li> number of doubles </li>
	<li> number of triples </li>
	<li> number of home runs </li>
	<li> number of runs batted in (RBI) </li>
	<li> batting average (3 decimal places, no leading zero </li>
</ol>

<p> Note that all fields within a record are separated by commas, and that
no field actually contains a comma. </p>

<p> Please review some of the Python examples from week 4 which demonstrate
how to retrieve files (either entire file or line by line) into Python.
Also, these examples demonstrate how to parse the line items into individual
fields. </p>


<h2> Notes, the data structures </h2>

<p> You will want to keep the keys (for both team and player lists) in a
sorted list for displaying a menu (easy access). For storing statistical
details, associating them with a player, associating players with teams,
please think about how you would store this. Nice tables will drive a lot of
the rest of your code. </p>

<p> You will probably choose to utilize some combination of Python's list
and dictionary types (list of dictionaries, dictionaries of lists, ....)
</p>

<p> You may parse the input file only once, so you need to store the
information for easy retrieval. </p>

<h2> What to hand in </h2>

<p>Submit the following files via <tt>submit_cli</tt> or <tt>submit_cli</tt>.
The assignment id is <tt><b>a2</b></tt> (small a).</p>

<ul>
	<li><tt><b>getPlayerStatistics.py</b></tt> - Your complete Python
	program</li>
	<li><tt><b>README</b></tt> <i>(optional)</i> - anything you want/need to
	tell us</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, use the filenames <b>as shown here</b>.  I.e.,
<tt>README.txt</tt> will <i>not</i> be read before grading, and
