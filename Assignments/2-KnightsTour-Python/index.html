<h1> Simulate the Knight's Tour </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> This assignment will give you practice with Python, data structures, and
design. </p>

<hr>
<h2> The Assignment </h2>

<p> You will write a Python program that attempts to solve the Knight's Tour
for a given board by brute-force methods.  The Knight's Tour is an attempt
to move the knight on a board, such that each space is visited exactly once.
See the Web for more information. </p>

<p> Your program will read 3 arguments: rows, columns, attempts .  The first
2 arguments are the size of the board, rows x columns.  The last argument is
the number of attempts to make. </p>

<p> The knight will start at (1, 1).  Look around, see what moves are
available, and randomly choose one (note, that is <strong>not</strong> the
same as randomly choosing a move, and then seeing if it's legal).  If you
have no more moves (and you haven't covered the board), then the knight
didn't make it. </p>

<p> You then continue with a fresh attempt, starting at (1, 1), until the
knight succeeds, or you've used up the number of attempts.  At the end,
whichever the outcome, you will print a history of the knight's last
attempt, w/a "success" or "failure" message.  E.g., given a 3x3 board,
output: </p>

<div><code>
<pre>FAIL:
 1  6  3 
 4  x  8 
 7  2  5</pre>
</code></div>


<hr>
<h3> Your code </h3>

<p> You'll need some smart way to store the moves you made on the board.
</p>

<hr>
<h3> Output </h3>

<p> The history of the last attempt, as described above. </p>

<hr>
<h2> Submission </h2>

<p> You can get some practise writing makefiles, and referencing environment
variables.  When I run your stuff, I will fill in 3 variables:
<code>KNIGHT_ROWS KNIGHT_COLS KNIGHT_ATTS</code> .  Do <strong>not</strong>
define these variables in your makefile.  The rule that runs your code might
look something like: </p>

<div><code> python yourfile $$KNIGHT_ROWS $$KNIGHT_COLS $$KNIGHT_ATTS
</code></div>

<p> Note the 2 <code>$$</code> .  To test your code you can add the vars to
your environment (don't forget to export them), or use the following form,
which only affects the subshell's environment: </p>

<div><code>
KNIGHT_ROWS=3 KNIGHT_COLS='8' KNIGHT_ATTS='40' make run
</code></div>

<p> Or, create other test targets in your makefile that hardcode inputs for
you. </p>

<p> Submit the following files: </p>

<ul>
	<li> <tt><b>makefile</b></tt> &mdash; with the following targets (at a
		minimum):
		<ul>
			<li> <tt><b>view</b></tt> &ndash; display <em>all</em> of your source
				code, using the pager <code>less</code> </li>
			<li> <tt><b>run</b></tt> &ndash; runs your program, pulling the
				arguments from the environment, as described above.
				<p> Make sure you turn echoing off, so <code>make</code> doesn't
				echo the command back to me. </p>
			</li>
			<li> <tt><b>clean</b></tt> &ndash; Removes any intermediate files (in
			this case, things w/a <code>pyc</code> extension) </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Any <strong>source</strong> files.  <tt>.pyc</tt> files will be
		deleted before I start, so, must be built from source. </li>
	<li> <tt><b>README</b></tt> <i>optional</i> - anything you want to say to
		me before I grade. </li>
</ul>

<b>Please note</b>  You will use the filenames as listed here, and submit
them all to the proper assignment.  If this is <b>not</b> clear, then see me
in class.  If I get programs submitted to the wrong directories, I will be
irate, which may, in some subconscious way, affect your grades.
