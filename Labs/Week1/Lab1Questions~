Q1: 
.bash_profile:
When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a  non-interactive  shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.   After  reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile

.bashrc:
When  an  interactive  shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from  /etc/bash.bashrc  and  ~/.bashrc
