Conclusions:
T(n) is increasing. So, it is bound below (but not tightly) by a constant. T(n) = ω( 1 ).

f(n) = n: still increasing to ∞. So, T(n) is bound below by a line, but not tightly. T(n) = ω( n ). In other words, T(n) grows faster than a line.

f(n) = n^2: T(n) / n^2 is tending towards some non-zero constant. So, T(n) = Θ( n^2 ).

f(n) = n^3: T(n)/n^3 is probably decreasing to zero. This means that n^3 is an upper bound, but not tight. I.e., T(n) grows more slowly than n^3. T(n) = ο( n^3 ).

# swap() Calls is increasing. So, it is bound below (but not tightly) by a constant. # swap() Calls= ω( 1 ).

f(n) = n: still increasing to ∞. So, # swap() Calls is bound below by a line, but not tightly. # swap() Calls= ω( n ). In other words, # swap() Calls grows faster than a line.
