This is where you maybe (quickly) outline the project, the files you've
submitted (what they do), how to compile and run (which should, largely, be
taken care of by your makefile).  But, there might be notes, like, "remember
that ARCHIVE needs to be defined in the environment".

This is also where you'd tell me anything you want to say before your
assignment is graded, so we know what to look for, that we might give you
points for, and you're not wasting our time.
