<h1>Lab - Design and Implementation</h1>

<p>Questions will be denoted with a <b><font size="=1">Q</font></b>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make some appropriate subdirectory for this lab and go there</li>
	<li>Copy (recursively) all the files from
	~kschmidt/public_html/CS265/Labs/Design/ to your lab directory (note that
	there is a symlink to a directory containing the C files).</li>
	</ul>

<h2>The Markov Chain algorithm</h2>
<ul>
	<li>We will use a sentinel string, <tt>"\n"</tt> (a single newline):
	<ul>
		<li>The very first (2-word) prefix (<tt>State</tt>) to be put into the
			table will be ("\n", "\n").  What follows is a suffix that would begin
			a text</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Note, there may be more than one suffix here, if we modified the
				program to read several input texts.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>The last <tt>State</tt> in a text will have, as a suffix, "\n"</li>
		<ul>
			<li>A "this is a fine place to stop" kind of token.</li>
			<li>Again, if multiple texts are input, there might be several good
				places to end a text in the table</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>The C implementation</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Look at markov.c</li>
	<li>Look at the 2 structs, and the array of <tt>State</tt> pointers,
		<tt>statetab</tt>:</li>
	<ul>
		</ul><h3><tt>statetab</tt></h3><ul>
		<li>The statetab *is* your hash table.</li>
		<li>A table of pointers to linked lists (a table of linked lists)</li>
		<li>The linked-lists contain entries</li>
		<li>Note, initially table is all NULL</li>
		</ul><h3><tt>struct State</tt></h3><ul>
		<li>The "buckets" are just linked-lists of <tt>State</tt>s</li>
		<li>Each entry (prefix) is stored in a <tt>State</tt> object</li>
		<li>Each entry (prefix) is stored exactly once in the table</li>
		</ul><h3><tt>struct Suffix</tt></h3><ul>
		<li>Each <tt>State</tt> is associated with one or more <i>suffices</i>
		<li>These suffices are stored in a linked-list.  This list is a State's
			<i>satellite data</i>; the <tt>State</tt> (prefix) is they key, the
			list is the associated data</li>
		<li><tt>Suffix</tt> is a node in this list; it stores a single
			suffix</li>
	</ul>

</ul><h3>Table Functions</h3><ul>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q1  What is the difference between <tt>add()</tt> and
	<tt>addSuffix</tt>?</font></p>

	<p><font size='+1'>Q2  What does <tt>lookup</tt> do?  Which function(s)
		call <tt>lookup</tt>?</font></p>

</ul><h3>Strings</h3><ul>
	<li>Note that space is allocated for each string (single word) exactly
		once</li>
	<li>Everybody maintains pointers to these things.</li>
	<li>Consider, as input:</li>
		<blockquote><tt>It's a new dawn</tt></blockquote>
	<li>Draw the table, much as in the notes, after <tt>build</tt> is called
		w/this input</li>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q3  Include the table in your lab sheet.  How many
		references (pointers) are there to each string:
		<ol type='a'>
			<li>"It's"</li>
			<li>"a"</li>
			<li>"new"</li>
			<li>"dawn"</li>
		</ol>?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q4 What are the advantages of this?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q5 What are the drawbacks?</font></p>
	<li>Does the program explicitly give this memory back?
	<li>Wherever we have more than one reference to heap memory we have a
		problem
	<p><font size='+1'>Q6 Write a function to clean up <tt>statetab</tt> when
		we're all done, give the memory back (don't spend a lot of time
		here).  In-line your function here, in the lab-sheet.</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q7 Does your function work properly?  What difficulties
		did you have?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q8 Take a step back from the table.  How could you make
		sure that each string was freed exactly once?</font></p>
</ul>

<h2>The C++ Implementation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Look at markov.cpp</li>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q9 How are the prefixes stored?  Why not use a
		vector?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q10 What serves as our dictionary (replaces our hash
		table)?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q11 How is the satellite data (list of suffices)
		stored?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q12 Are there any advantages to this implementation
		over the C implementation?  What are they?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q13 Are there any drawbacks?</font></p>
</ul>

<h2>The Python Implementation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Look at markov.py</li>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q14 How are the prefixes stored?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q15 What serves as our dictionary (replaces our hash
		table)?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q16 How is the satellite data (list of suffices)
		stored?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q17 Are there any advantages to this implementation
		over the C++ implementation?  What are they?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q18 Are there any drawbacks?</font></p>
</ul>

<h2>Strictly for Fun</h2>

<p>You don't need to submit anything here.</p>

<p>See the <tt>fortune</tt> directory (do a <tt>man</tt>; it moves around a
little bit).  It's usually somewhere around
<tt>/usr/share/games/fortune</tt>.</p>

<p>Modify one of the above implementations so, instead of an entire file
being a "story" (a start and stop place), each entry in the fortunes files
(separated by a %) is a new "story".</p>

<!-- We don't do Perl anymore
<h2>The Perl Implementation</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Look at markov.pl</li>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q14 How are the prefixes stored?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q15 What serves as our dictionary (replaces our hash
		table)?</font></p>
	<p><font size='+1'>Q16 How is the satellite data (list of suffices)
		stored?</font></p>

<p><font size='+1'>Q17 Which implementation makes is easiest for you to
	understand what how a Markov chain is built/used?  Why?  (There isn't a
	single correct answer here.)
