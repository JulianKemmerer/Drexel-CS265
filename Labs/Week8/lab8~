Q1:
1. Hide implementation details: The user of your implimentation should not be concerned with or aware of exactly way your class functions - only that it does correctly.
2. Choose a small orthogonal set of primitives: Do not have functions/methods etc. that perform the same task in multiple ways.
3. Don't reach behind the user's back: Do not make changes other than exactly what is stated in your implementations documentation.
4. Do the same thing the same way everywhere: Use the same formatting everywhere (ex. function argument order) so that the user is not confused with changing formats
